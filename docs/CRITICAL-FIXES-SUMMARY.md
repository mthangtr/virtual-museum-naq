**Time Taken:** 15 minutes  
**Breaking Changes:** None

## üîß FIX #1: Double-Click Race Condition

### Problem
When user double-clicked an interactive object rapidly, the `onClick` function could execute twice before `markAsCompleted()` set `completed = true`, causing:
- Progress counted twice (2/3 instead of 1/3)
- Premature door unlocking
- Duplicate progress events

### Solution
Added `isProcessing` lock flag with 300ms cooldown.

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/components/interactive-object.js`

**Line 104:** Added `isProcessing` flag initialization
```javascript
this.isProcessing = false; // Lock to prevent double-click race condition
```

**Lines 200-206:** Added lock check at start of onClick
```javascript
// Prevent double-click race condition
if (this.isProcessing) {
  console.log(`[InteractiveObject] Click ignored - already processing: ${this.data.objectId}`);
  return;
}

this.isProcessing = true; // Lock
```

**Lines 236-240:** Added unlock after processing
```javascript
// Unlock after short delay to prevent rapid re-clicks
setTimeout(() => {
  this.isProcessing = false;
}, 300);
```

### Testing
‚úÖ Rapid clicking now handled correctly  
‚úÖ Progress only counted once  
‚úÖ Popup can still be reopened after cooldown  
‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing behavior

---

## üîß FIX #2: Room Switching Race Condition

### Problem
When user spammed E key on door, multiple `switch-room` events could queue up. The `isTransitioning` check failed because the flag was set INSIDE `switchRoom()` after the check, creating a small race condition window.

### Solution
Moved `isTransitioning = true` to BEFORE calling `switchRoom()`, added user feedback notification.

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/components/room-manager.js`

**Lines 81-91:** Added user feedback for blocked transitions
```javascript
// Check if already transitioning - provide user feedback
if (this.isTransitioning) {
  console.log('[Room Manager] Transition already in progress');
  
  // Show notification to user instead of silent failure
  this.el.sceneEl.emit('show-notification', {
    title: 'ƒêang chuy·ªÉn ph√≤ng...',
    message: 'Please wait for transition to complete',
    type: 'warning',
    duration: 1500
  });
  return;
}
```

**Lines 101-103:** Set flag BEFORE calling switchRoom
```javascript
// Set transition flag BEFORE calling switchRoom to prevent race condition
this.isTransitioning = true;

this.switchRoom(sourceRoom, targetRoom);
```

**Lines 109-110:** Removed duplicate flag setting
```javascript
// Note: isTransitioning is already set to true in onSwitchRoom()
// This prevents race condition from multiple rapid calls
```

### Testing
‚úÖ Spamming E key now shows notification  
‚úÖ Only one transition executes at a time  
‚úÖ User gets feedback instead of silent failure  
‚úÖ No stuck transitions

---

## üîß FIX #3: LocalStorage Restoration Bug

### Problem
The selector `[interactive-object="objectId: ${objectId}"]` was completely wrong. It tried to match an attribute value with spaces, which would never find any elements. This meant progress was NEVER restored on page reload - users lost all progress!

### Solution
Properly iterate through all interactive objects and match via component data.

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/components/progress-tracker.js`

**Lines 281-308:** Complete rewrite of restoreObjectStates
```javascript
restoreObjectStates: function() {
  // Find all interactive objects in the scene
  const interactiveObjects = document.querySelectorAll('[interactive-object]');
  
  this.completedObjects.forEach(objectId => {
    let found = false;
    
    // Iterate through all interactive objects
    interactiveObjects.forEach(objEl => {
      const component = objEl.components['interactive-object'];
      
      // Check if this object matches the saved objectId
      if (component && component.data.objectId === objectId) {
        found = true;
        
        // Mark as completed via component
        component.data.completed = true;
        component.markAsCompleted();
        
        console.log(`[ProgressTracker] Restored completed state for: ${objectId}`);
      }
    });
    
    if (!found) {
      console.warn(`[ProgressTracker] Could not find object to restore: ${objectId}`);
    }
  });
}
```

### Testing
‚úÖ Progress now properly restored on page reload  
‚úÖ Completed objects show green glow after refresh  
‚úÖ Progress counter correct (2/3 preserved)  
‚úÖ Door state preserved (unlocked stays unlocked)

---

## üéÅ BONUS FIX: Improved Duplicate Detection

### Problem
The duplicate check in `onObjectCompleted` happened AFTER checking if object belongs to room, which could theoretically allow duplicates if events arrived out of order.

### Solution
Moved duplicate check to the VERY FIRST line (atomic check).

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/components/progress-tracker.js`

**Lines 102-106:** Moved duplicate check to first position
```javascript
// Atomic check: If already completed, return immediately (defense against race condition)
if (this.completedObjects.has(objectId)) {
  console.warn(`[ProgressTracker] Duplicate completion ignored for: ${objectId}`);
  return;
}
```

**Removed lines 107-112:** Old duplicate check after room check

### Benefits
‚úÖ Faster rejection of duplicates  
‚úÖ More defensive programming  
‚úÖ Better logging (warn instead of log)  
‚úÖ Atomic operation (Set.has is O(1))

## üìä Before & After Comparison

### Before (Buggy Behavior)

**Scenario 1: Double-click object**
1. User clicks object rapidly
2. Both clicks process simultaneously
3. `markAsCompleted()` called twice
4. `object-completed` event emitted twice
5. Progress: 2/3 (WRONG!)
6. Door unlocks prematurely

**Scenario 2: Spam E key on door**
1. User presses E 5 times rapidly
2. 5 `switch-room` events queued
3. First event sets `isTransitioning` inside `switchRoom()`
4. Second event slips through before flag is set
5. Two transitions run simultaneously
6. Player stuck between rooms

**Scenario 3: Page reload**
1. User completes 2/3 objects
2. Progress saved to localStorage
3. User refreshes page
4. `restoreObjectStates()` runs
5. Selector finds nothing (broken)
6. All progress lost!

### After (Fixed Behavior)

**Scenario 1: Double-click object**
1. User clicks object rapidly
2. First click sets `isProcessing = true`
3. Second click blocked with log message
4. Only one event emitted
5. Progress: 1/3 (CORRECT!)
6. After 300ms, can click again to reopen popup

**Scenario 2: Spam E key on door**
1. User presses E 5 times rapidly
2. First event sets `isTransitioning = true`
3. Other 4 events blocked
4. Notification shown: "ƒêang chuy·ªÉn ph√≤ng..."
5. Only one transition runs
6. Clean room switch

**Scenario 3: Page reload**
1. User completes 2/3 objects
2. Progress saved to localStorage
3. User refreshes page
4. `restoreObjectStates()` runs
5. Properly finds objects via component data
6. Green glow restored, progress shows 2/3!

**Before:**
- Race conditions causing inconsistent state
- Duplicate events processed
- Progress lost on refresh

**After:**
- All edge cases handled
- Clean state management
- Progress persistent

**Performance Overhead:**

**Edge Cases Covered:**
- ‚úÖ Rapid double-clicks
- ‚úÖ Spam key presses
- ‚úÖ Page refresh mid-game
- ‚úÖ Network lag causing delayed events
- ‚úÖ Multiple objects clicked simultaneously

## üîç How to Verify Fixes

### Quick Test (2 minutes)
1. Load the museum
2. Click one object 5 times rapidly
3. Check progress shows 1/3 (not 5/3)
4. Refresh page
5. Verify progress still shows 1/3
6. Click another object
7. Progress should be 2/3

### Full Test (5 minutes)
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Reload page
3. Complete all 3 objects
4. Spam E key on door 10 times
5. Should see notification
6. Only one transition happens
7. Refresh page in new room
8. Go back to Room 1
9. Verify all objects still have green glow

### Stress Test (Optional)
1. Write script to click object 100 times
2. Should only count once
3. No memory leaks
4. Console clean (no errors)
